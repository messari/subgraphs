##### SCHEMA GUIDELINES
#
### Usage
# - This schema is intended to be a "master" document for standardization work. It includes all possible protocol
#   categories and entities. To implement a specific protocol, you should only include entities that are relevant
#   to that particular protocol. For example, to implement Aave, you should only include the lending protocol
#   entities and leave out the rest.
#
### Naming Conventions
# - Enum values should be in all caps
# - Common types
#   - hash/address: String
#   - block height: BigInt
#   - timestamp: unix timestamp in BigInt
#   - token amount: All token amounts should be BigInt to preserve precision (i.e. in wei)
#   - dollar amount: All USD amounts (including prices) should be BigDecimal
# - Certain prefixes may be used to indicate a particular type of value.
#   * total - indicates this is a cumulative value (e.g. totalSharesMinted, totalGrossReturns)
#   * balance - indicates this is a spot balance (e.g. balanceTokensInvested, balanceTokensIdle)
#   * delta - indicates this value is the difference between the prior state and the current state (e.g. deltaPricePerShare)
#   * current - used exclusively in Update entities. Similar to balance, current indicates the state of a field or value at the
#               time of the update. These values are populated in every update whether they changed or not.
#   * new - used exclusively in Update entities. Fields with this prefix will only be populated if they have changed since the
#           last Update. If there has been no change, the value will be null.
# - Use plurals when referring to Tokens or Shares (e.g. totalShares, balanceTokens)
#
### Quantitative Data
# - There are 3 ways in which quantitative data are stored and fetched:
#   1. Real-time: you can get real-time data by querying on specific entities. For example, get `totalValueLockedUSD`
#      from a `Pool`.
#   2. Point-in-time: you can get point-in-time (including historical) data on specific entities using time-travel queries.
#   3. Time-series: the best way to get time-series data is by querying snapshots. For example, get `totalValueLockedUSD` from
#      `PoolDailySnapshot`.

"""
An event is any user action that occurs in a protocol. Generally, they are Ethereum events
emitted by a function in the smart contracts, stored in transaction receipts as event logs.
However, some user actions of interest are function calls that don't emit events. For example,
the deposit and withdraw functions in Yearn do not emit any events. In our subgraphs, we still
store them as events, although they are not technically Ethereum events emitted by smart
contracts.
