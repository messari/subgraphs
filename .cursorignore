# Don't ignore the subgraphs directory itself
!subgraphs/

# But ignore all its contents
subgraphs/*

# Except for the curve-finance directory and its contents
!subgraphs/curve-finance/
!subgraphs/curve-finance/**

# This pattern works by:
# 1. Ignoring everything (*)
# 2. Making an exception for the subgraphs directory (!subgraphs/)
# 3. Ignoring all contents of subgraphs (subgraphs/*)
# 4. Making an exception for curve-finance and its contents
