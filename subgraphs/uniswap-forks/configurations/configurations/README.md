# Configurations
- This folder contains the general configurations to use for the deployed networks/protocols

## deploy.ts
- Include a nameswap value for each protocol/network deployement. Structure these values as `PROTOCOL_NETWORK` as seen in the file as an example. 
- Set the namespace value to a number. This is so the namespace value works in the case/switch in the configurations.ts file
- Also, add the to the `PROTOCOL_NETWORK` like "deployment": "PROTOCOL_NETWORK" in the network specific conficuration .json file. 
## interface.ts
- The interface contains all of the fields and data types that will be stored in the Configurations class for use in the program
## configurations.ts
- This file is just used to select the proper configurations per protocol/network.
