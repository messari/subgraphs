# Kelp DAO Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

The Kelp DAO team is currently building an LRT solution, rsETH, on EigenLayer for Ethereum.

rsETH is a Liquid Restaked Token (LRT) issued by Kelp DAO designed to offer liquidity to illiquid assets deposited into restaking platforms, such as EigenLayer. It aims to address the risks and challenges posed by the current offering of restaking

1. Restakers stake their LST to mint rsETH tokens indicating fractional ownership of the underlying assets
2. rsETH contracts distribute the deposited tokens into different Node Operators that operate with the Kelp DAO
3. Rewards accrue from the various services to the rsETH contracts. The price of rsETH token assumes the underlying price of the various rewards and staked tokens
4. Restakers can swap their rsETH tokens for other tokens on AMMs for instant liquidity or choose to redeem underlying assets through rsETH contracts
5. Restakers can further leverage their rsETH tokens in DeFi

## Metrics

### Usage and Transactions

- Restaker deposits LST and mints rsETH
- Unstake/Withdrawal of assets

### TVL

Total LST staked to mint rsETH.

### Fees and Revenue

At present, Kelp DAO does not impose any fees on LST deposits.
