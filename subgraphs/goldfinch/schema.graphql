"""
An event is any user action that occurs in a protocol. Generally, they are Ethereum events
emitted by a function in the smart contracts, stored in transaction receipts as event logs.
However, some user actions of interest are function calls that don't emit events. For example,
the deposit and withdraw functions in Yearn do not emit any events. In our subgraphs, we still
store them as events, although they are not technically Ethereum events emitted by smart
contracts.

  # (1) `Unstaked` and `UnstakedMultiple` events are not emitted mutually exclusively by the StakingRewards
  # contract; on the contrary, for every `UnstakedMultiple` event, a corresponding set of `Unstaked`
  # events are emitted whose params collectively comprise the same data as the `UnstakedMultiple` event.
  # So we don't need to index `UnstakedMultiple` events for the sake of obtaining any unique data. And
  # doing so would only create a need for the consumer of the subgraph to de-duplicate between an
  # `UnstakedMultiple` event and its corresponding set of `Unstaked` events.
  # (2) The positions unstaked in an `UnstakedMultiple` event can be of different types (e.g. FIDU
  # and Curve LP), so their respective amounts are not necessarily commensurable, so summing
  # them to a total amount would be inappropriate. Our `Transaction` schema currently supports
  # only a single `amount` value for the transaction, so it "wants" us to do such summing. But we
