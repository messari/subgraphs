### Notes

- The PLY, USN, AURORA, and TRI markets do not allow for borrows. For some reason the price oracle doesn't work with them. Instead we can derive price from another method.
  - To get price we are using LP pools from Trisolaris
  - The USN market will be missing price for the first month.
  - PLY market will be missing price for the first 2 days.
  - stNEAR is missing accurate pricing for the first 2 weeks.
