# Introduction of Stargate

## General

Stargate is a community-driven organization building the first fully composable native asset bridge, and the first dApp built on LayerZero.

DeFi users can swap native assets cross-chain on Stargate within a single transaction. These cross-chain swaps are supported by the community-owned Stargate unified liquidity pools.

## Metrics

### Usage and Transactions

Users of Stargate are people who either transfer assets across blockchains or provide liquidity to the pools.

### TVL

TVL is the total liquidity in asset pools.

### Fees

Each non-STG transfer through the Stargate protocol will incur a 6 bps fee:

- Protocol Treasury: 4 bps
- Liquidity Providers: 1 bp
- veSTG Holders: 1 bp

Additionally, Stargate transfers may incur a pool rebalance fee depending on how imbalanced the source & destination transfer pools are with respect to pool equilibrium weights.

STG tokens transfers do not incur a pool rebalancing fee.

### Revenue

Part of the transfer fee allocated to Protocol Treasury is counted in Protocol Side Revenue.
Part of the transfer fee allocated to Liquidity Providers is counted in Supply Side Revenue.

### Rewards

Users can add liquidity to token-chain pools and receive LP Tokens. They can then farm these LP tokens to earn STG rewards.
