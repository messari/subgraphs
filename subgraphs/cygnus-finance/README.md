# Cygnus Finance Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

Cygnus Finance is a RWA stablecoin protocol built on pure, short-term U.S. debt assets. It is also the first native interest-bearing stablecoin protocol and the first native RWA protocol on Base.

Each lending pool represents a pair of 2 tokens of a DEX. Lenders can supply tokens to any lending pool to earn passive yield without impermanent loss. Borrowers can deposit LP tokens in a lending pool to borrow tokens of the token pair. This enables borrowers to leverage their LP tokens and get even more LP tokens, allowing for leveraged yield farming and enhanced LP rewards.
