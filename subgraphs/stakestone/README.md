# Stakestone Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

StakeStone is an omni-chain LST (Liquid Staking Token) protocol aiming to bring native staking yields and
liquidity to Layer 2s in a decentralized manner. With its highly scalable architecture, StakeStone not only
supports leading staking pools but is also compatible with the upcoming restaking. Meanwhile, it establishes a
multi-chain liquidity market based on STONE, StakeStoneâ€™s native LST, provides users of STONE with more use
cases and yield opportunities.

Based on LayerZero, STONE is a non-rebase OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) that supports both assets and
prices to be transferred across multiple blockchains seamlessly.
