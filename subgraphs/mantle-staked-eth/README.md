# Mantle Staked ETH Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP) is a permissionless, non-custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. Mantle Staked Ether (mETH) serves as the value-accumulating receipt token.

## Metrics

### Usage and Transactions

- Stake ETH to instantly receive mETH.
- Unstake mETH to reclaim the initially staked ETH and accumulated rewards, with delays synchronized with the estimated "Exit Queue" wait time, and the Unstake Lifecycle.

### TVL

TVL is the total value of ETH staked with the protocol.

### Fees

Protocol applies a 10% fee on a userâ€™s staking rewards. This fee is split between protocol and the node operators.

### Revenue

Staking rewards on the total staked ETH make up the total revenue.
Of this 10% is kept by the protocol as fees (protocol side revenue), rest 90% is passed on to the stakers (supply side revenue).

_Note_: ConsensusLayer and ExecutionLayer rewards are collected every ~8 days, hence there are peaks and troughs in revenue charts. [docs](https://docs.mantle.xyz/meth/concepts/accounting/calculating-fees).
