An event is any user action that occurs in a protocol. Generally, they are Ethereum events
emitted by a function in the smart contracts, stored in transaction receipts as event logs.
However, some user actions of interest are function calls that don't emit events. For example,
the deposit and withdraw functions in Yearn do not emit any events. In our subgraphs, we still
store them as events, although they are not technically Ethereum events emitted by smart
