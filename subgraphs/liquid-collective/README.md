# Liquid Collective Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

Liquid Collective is the secure liquid staking standard: a protocol designed to meet the needs of institutions, built and run by a collective of leading web3 teams.
The Liquid Collective protocol will ultimately provide multi-chain liquid staking capabilities, starting first with Ethereum support.

When a user deposits to the Liquid Collective protocol, they receive an equivalent liquid staking token that evidences their legal and beneficial ownership of the underlaying staked asset as well as any network rewards that accrue, minus protocol service fees and network slashing penalties, if any.

## Metrics

### Usage and Transactions

- Stake Eth for LsETH
- Redeem LsETH for ETH

### TVL

- Total Eth staked with the protocol OR the total LsETH minted by the protocol

### Revenue

- Protocol Side: The Liquid Collective protocol charges a service fee set at 15.0% of network rewards. Liquid Collectiveâ€™s service fee is split amongst Node Operators, Platforms, Wallet & Custody Providers, Service Providers, the protocol's Slashing Coverage Treasury, and the Liquid Collective DAO, which comprises a broad and dispersed community of protocol participants.
- Supply Side: The remaining 85% of the network rewards are passed on to the stakers.
