# BadgerDAO Subgraph

## Known Issue

The `bDigg` vault of badger finance with contract address `0x7e7E112A68d8D2E221E11047a72fFC1065c38e1a`
has issue related to the input token price. The price for `Digg` token with address `0x798d1be841a82a273720ce31c822c61a67a601c3`
is currently fetched from `SushiSwapRouter` which results in incorrect values since block `11680422`.

The entities `Deposit` and `Withdraw` which stores the `amountUSD` for the tokens is incorrect for
above mentioned vault. Since, the amountUSD is used to calculate various financial metrics, hence
entity `FinancialsDailySnapshot` will also is affected.
