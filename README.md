Messari subgraphs set an industry leading standard for on chain data ðŸš€

Utilizing [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) these subgraphs extract raw blockchain data and transform it into meaningful metrics, for products and analytics.

## Working Environment

Go to [`docs/SETUP.md`](./docs/SETUP.md) to learn how to setup your machine for Messari subgraph development.

## Learn the Project

It is important to familiarize yourself with the project structure and tooling to build efficiently. Go to [`docs/STRUCTURE.md`](./docs/STRUCTURE.md) and [`docs/TOOLING.md`](./docs/TOOLING.md) to learn more.

- Familiarize yourself with our schemas labeled `schema-{protocol type}.graphql`. Read more details in [`docs/SCHEMA.md`](./docs/SCHEMA.md)
- We update our schemas as necessary. You can find out about each upgrade in [`docs/CHANGES.md`](./docs/CHANGES.md)

## Becoming a Subgraph Developer

Becoming a good subgraph developer will take patience and practice. The following resources are for developers of all skill levels to learn the ins and outs of subgraph development. ðŸ‘¾

- For a full walkthrough of our subgraph development process visit [`docs/WALKTHROUGH.md`](./docs/WALKTHROUGH.md).
- Resources for development of varying levels can be found in [`docs/RESOURCES.md`](./docs/RESOURCES.md).
- To learn about common errors, best error handling practices, and debugging see [`docs/ERRORS.md`](./docs/ERRORS.md)
- Subgraph performance is also a concern. Learn about indexing / querying performance by reading [`docs/PERFORMANCE`](./docs/PERFORMANCE.md)
- To learn about Messari standard methodologies see [`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`](./docs/METHODOLOGY.md)
- Learn about pricing and how to handle this in [`docs/ORACLES.md`](./docs/ORACLES.md)
