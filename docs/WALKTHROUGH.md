# Walkthrough

This document will walk you through the process of building a subgraph from start to finish.

> This will assume you have gone through the previously mentioned docs in the [README.md](../README.md)

## Overview

A brief overview of what you can expect when building a subgraph:

- Familiarize yourself with the project, graphql, typescript, and the graph
- Understand the protocol
- Copy a template subgraph
- Define the manifest for the protocol
- Begin with mapping the granular events
- Deploy and test
- Check for issues (and iterate)
- Get higher level metrics and aggregate
- Populate the snapshots
- Hand off for review

## Familiarization

This step is simpler said than done. It will take a little bit of time to get familiar with everything. This includes:

- The project (understand the previous docs)
- Graphql and typescript (use the Introductory module in [RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md))
- Understand the graph ([this](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/) is a good place to start)
- You should also understand the protocol on a technical level
  - A good place to start is their docs and reading their smart contracts

You will learn a lot as you build subgraphs, so don't stress about learning every little thing here.

## Fork

You should fork this repo and work off of that. You can find docs about updating your fork and rebasing in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Create a Template

Now that you have a subgraph you want to make using a Messari standard schema you can start by copying over the template subgraph. This folder is named `_reference_`. Go through this and remove anything that is unnecessary for your case. For example, if you are building a dex subgraph, you don't need the lending library.

Some of the notable things in this folder:

- There is a pricing library you can learn more about [here](../subgraphs/_reference_/src/prices/README.md)
- There are some common mapping functions that you can reuse to reduce the amount of rework needed
- Ensure you are using the right schema for your subgraph type found in the head of the repo
- Folder names use [kebab-case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case) in all lower case
- File names use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) with a preceding lowercase letter

## Create a PR

At this point you have a little work done. You should make a PR and convert it to a Draft so we can track the status and suggest changes as you build! To do this follow the notes in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Define the Manifest

This means to start figuring out what contracts, events, and abis you will need and updating the `subgraph.yaml` template accordingly. In some protocols there will (hopefully) be a factory contract. This contract will create and deploy other contracts. These deployed contracts are going to usually be templates in the `subgraph.yaml` file.

You want to only include the ABIs used in each `dataSource`. Excess will start to bloat the file and make it difficult to read.

Then you want to find the important events in the contracts and start by marking those events to create handlers in the `subgraph.yaml`.

## deployment.json

You should add your subgraph status to the `deployment.json` file following the same structure as all of the other protocols. This will allow you to properly use `messari-subgraph-cli` to deploy your subgraph.

## Begin Mappings

Now that you have some of the events defined you can start to write the handlers for these events in `src/mapping.ts`.

If this is your first subgraph I would recommend starting with a log in the handler to list some data. This can be simple like displaying block data:

```typescript
export function handleDeposit(event: Deposit): void {
  log.warning("transaction hash: {} Block number: {}", [
    event.transaction.hash.toHexString(),
    event.block.number.toString(),
  ]);
}
```

Play around with this, compare hashes on etherscan and help yourself understand some of the behavior.

## Deploy and Test

Now you want to deploy your subgraph. The easiest way to deploy is to the hosted service (this is being sunsetted so the alternative is the subgraph studio). You can deploy using the `messari-subgraph-cli` tool. You can learn more about this tool [here](./TOOLING.md).

Quickly you can run `messari b -d` and follow the prompts to deploy.

## Check for Issues and Iterate

This is going to be part of the process. You will need to do things over as bugs arise and logic is incorrect. Luckily we have dealt with a lot of issues so far. The following is a good start:

- If you need help debugging, finding fixes to errors, or how to fix errors see [ERRORS.md](./ERRORS.md)
- To find issues and check subgraphs as you re-deploy use [okgraph](https://okgraph.xyz/)
- [Miniscan](https://miniscan.xyz/) is particularly helpful for historical contract calls to see what is being returned.
- Look at the [TOOLING.md](./TOOLING.md) for more tools to help you in this!
- If you are still stuck don't hesitate to make a post in the discord! ðŸ‘½

## Higher Level Metrics

Now you will need to start gathering some less granular metrics. This may include revenue, interest rates, other pool metrics. For these it is more common to use contract calls. For these calls it is standard practice to make a "try call" like this:

```typescript
let contract = Contract.bind(event.address);
let result = contract.try_getSomeData();
if (!result.reverted) {
  // do something with result.value
}
```

> Note: contract calls slow down indexing; however, if it is not available in an event a contract call is the most accurate way.

## Snapshots

Now that you have filled in a lot of the granular and high level metrics it is time to aggregate data and populate snapshots. The logic here is the same from subgraph to subgraph within the same schema so we helped you here. We are building standard libraries for this in the `_reference_` subgraph.

You should look at those and leverage them to create, populate, and store data in snapshots. It is very convenient to copy/paste battle tested logic to save development time!

## Github Actions

When you move your PR to "Ready for Review" it will trigger Github Actions to run. This will test a few things:

1. The directory structure is correct
2. The subgraph follows all of the typescript development standards
3. The subgraph codegen and builds without any errors

To check the lint locally you can run `npx eslint ./` to see errors and `npx eslint ./ --fix` to fix them. This needs to point to the head of your subgraph's directory.

The 3rd check is essentially just running `messari b` on the subgraph. This is something you will be doing consistently as you develop the subgraph.

## Are We Done??

At this point you may be close to finishing! Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ you have built a Messari standard subgraph!

It is not quite done. Review your PR and make sure all of the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) are being followed. Make some checks to make sure your data is looking good in [subgraphs.xyz](https://subgraphs.messari.io/). Then assign a reviewer and notify them. And validate against some existing data sources:

- Project's official analytics dashboard
- [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/) (for TVL)
- [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/)
- [TokenTerminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal)

I hate to break it to you, but nothing is ever perfect the first time. There will be more to iterate on, but this is an opportunity to learn and improve from an experienced subgraph developer.

Next the subgraph will be QA'd by a protocol specialist, and if that passes it is `prod` ready. This means we will integrate it into Messari's product that is powered by subgraphs. It is called Protocol Metrics and you can play with it [here](https://messari.io/protocol-explorer/all-protocols) (if you have any feedback don't hesitate to reach out)!
